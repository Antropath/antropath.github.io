I am AI/ML lead consultant at [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/).

I help the largest AWS customers define an AI/ML strategy, build their ML teams, develop ML solutions and deploy them at scale.

I have led projects in many areas of applied ML (including CV, tabular ML, forecasting, explainability, Generative AI, optimization) and industries (including manufacturing & industrials, automotive, health care & life sciences, government).

I particularly enjoy working at the intersection of different areas in ML, or of ML with other fields. Examples are my work on Digital Twins or quantum computing (see [blog](/blog).).

I also get hands-on with the (many) other aspects required to make ML work in the real world - from data engineering, DevOps/MLOps to application development and people & process changes.

I regularly share my experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsauerwein/) and in [blog](/blog) posts. For example, I am co-author of the blogs introducing the AWS Digital Twin Framework and of posts showing how best practices from ML can be used in quantum computing.

Previously, I worked at [Faculty](https://faculty.ai/) in London as a Data Scientist. Before that I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/sp-physik/index.html.en) and the [Max Planck Institue for Quantum Optics](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/en), focussing on quantum information & computation. You can find my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5yn1bREAAAAJ&hl=en).
