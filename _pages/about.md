I am AI/ML lead consultant at [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/).

I help the largest customers understand the value of their data, define an AI/ML strategy, build their ML teams, develop ML solutions and deploy them at scale.

My main ML interests are in probabilistic modelling, time series forecasting and physics-related ML. However, I also get hands-on with the (many, many, many) other aspects required to make ML work in the real world - from data engineering, DevOps/MLOps to application development and people & process changes.

I regularly share my experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsauerwein/). My thought leadership & technical content is listed in the [blog](/blog) section. For example, I am co-author of the blogs introducing the AWS Digital Twin Framework and wrote about how ML best practices for quantum computing.

Previously, I worked at [Faculty](https://faculty.ai/) in London as a Data Scientist. Before that I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/sp-physik/index.html.en) and the [Max Planck Institue for Quantum Optics](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/en), focussing on quantum information & computation.
