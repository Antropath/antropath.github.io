I am AI/ML lead consultant at [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/).

I help the largest AWS customers understand the value of their data, define an AI/ML strategy, build their ML teams, develop ML solutions and deploy them at scale.

In have led projects in many different areas of applied ML (CV, tabular ML, forecasting, explainability, NLP,...). I also get hands-on with the (many) other aspects required to make ML work in the real world - from data engineering, DevOps/MLOps to application development and people & process changes. My personal interests are in probabilistic modelling, time series forecasting and physics-related ML.

I regularly share my experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsauerwein/). My thought leadership & technical content is listed in the [blog](/blog) section. I am co-author of the blogs introducing the AWS Digital Twin Framework and showed about how best practices from ML can be used in quantum computing, to mention two of my favorite examples.

Previously, I worked at [Faculty](https://faculty.ai/) in London as a Data Scientist. Before that I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/sp-physik/index.html.en) and the [Max Planck Institue for Quantum Optics](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/en), focussing on quantum information & computation. You can find my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5yn1bREAAAAJ&hl=en).
